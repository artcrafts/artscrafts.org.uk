              <p>
                One of the essential features of the development of the movement
                was the establishment of guilds and societies, binding together
                artists, craftsmen and designers. These groups were similar to
                the medieval guilds of tradesmen, but an important difference
                was that they were made up of different trades or crafts working
                together in an equal partnership of arts and crafts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artists sculptors, designers, architects, craftsmen in stained
                glass, pottery and other crafts were all equally involved and no
                art or craft was considered superior to any other. The Guilds
                helped to bring artist and craftsmen together and helped to
                publicise the movement through meetings, lectures, exhibitions
                and demonstrations of particular crafts. The Studio magazine,
                from 1893 onwards regularly reviewed Arts and Crafts exhibitions
                and featured articles on individual designers and techniques
                such as repousse copper work, embroidery and furniture design.
                Articles featuring the work of Ballie Scott, Voysey, Ashbee,
                Glasgow School and other leading figures were frequently
                included with illustrations of their designs and finished work.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the first attempts to establish a Guild was Ruskin's
                Guild of St George which was set up in 1871. The Guild failed in
                its ambitious aims which included taking a stand against the
                industrialisation of society, seeking to replace it by a
                medieval order with a common interest in the quality of life and
                work.
              </p>
              <p>
                A more realistic and practical effort was a commercial venture
                led by Authur Heygate Mackmurdo who established the Century
                Guild of Artists in 1882. Mackmurdo, an architect who had had
                taught himself metal work, carving, furniture making, and
                embroidery, was one of the founding members. Whilst he had
                become a skilled designer himself he recognised his limitations
                and realised the need to recruit craftsmen already working in
                the applied arts to join together in a commercial venture. In
                1884 'The Hobby Horse' magazine was started by the Guild, to
                encourage the revival of arts and crafts.
              </p>
              <h2>The first Arts and Crafts exhibitions.</h2>
              <p>
                In 1884 the Art Workers Guild was founded by a group of
                prominent Arts and Crafts architects who were later joined by
                members of 'The Fifteen', a group of artists architects,
                craftsmen and designers. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society
                developed out of the Art Workers Guild, holding its first
                exhibition in 1888, which was when the term 'Arts and Crafts'
                was first used to describe the growing movement. Exhibitions
                were held periodically until the outbreak of the first world war
                in 1914.
              </p>
              <p>
                A. H. Mackmurdo described in his diary the aims of the first
                Arts and Crafts exhibition in 1888, which included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <div class="ld">
                    To show the British public what could be done by their
                    contemporary fellow craftsmen in making beautiful things for
                    the homes of simple and gentle folk.
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="ld">
                    To revive the desire for beauty in the things of everyday
                    use...
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="ld">
                    To arouse among art workers an emulation to excel by placing
                    the work of various designers and craftsmen side by side.
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="ld">
                    To turn industry in the direction of producing such kind of
                    decorative form as can be produced without detriment by
                    mechanical process.
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>The School of Handicraft.</h2>
              <p>
                The School of Handicraft started in 1887 and the Guild of
                Handicraft started in 1888 were largely the work of Charles
                Robert Ashbee. Ashbee, like several of the leading figures was
                from a wealthy background, educated at Cambridge and started his
                career as an architect. Many of the most admired products of the
                Guild, metal work and jewellery in particular were designed by
                Ashbee. The Guild was based at Essex House in Mile End Road in
                London until 1902 when it moved to Chipping Campden in the
                Cotswolds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Guilds and Societies which started within the last 15 years
                of the nineteenth century were the forerunners of a much wider
                movement which flourished through to the 1930's. At one level
                this included the establishment of artistic communities where
                artists and craftsmen lived and worked together as in Newlyn,
                Keswick and Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. At a broader
                level the movement encompassed a whole range of local societies,
                exhibitions, schools and night classes teaching and encouraging
                handicrafts and artistic techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                There were high minded ideals behind the establishment of
                community crafts industries, socialist or philanthropic notions
                for regenerating rural communities where the traditional
                industry had declined. The Craft Revival was also fuelled by the
                new ideals of Arts Schools and Colleges in London, Liverpool,
                Birmingham and Glasgow where there was a push to develop applied
                art. This involved forging links with local industries, the
                training of local artisans and supporting the development of
                education in art and craft for the widest possible audiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                As well the Academic influence there were commercial ventures
                established to help sell arts and crafts products. The Home Arts
                Industries for example was founded in 1884 to provide a London
                shop for craft products and to coordinate the efforts of craft
                workers across the country. Haslemere Peasant Industries was set
                up by Godfrey Blount in 1896 as an artistic community in Surrey
                and as marketing organisation for local workshops with a London
                shop for the sale of work.

                  alt="Detail from Newlyn copper inkwell"
                  class="caption"
                  src="../../sites/default/files/images/inkwell.jpg"
                  style="float: right;"
                  title="Detail from Newlyn copper inkwell"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                The articles produced by the Guilds and Societies varied in
                quality with some exceptional pieces being created. Much sought
                after today is the metalwork in copper which was crafted at the
                Newlyn School established in 1890 by John MacKenzie. Copper
                chargers, vases, and other decorative items which were embossed
                with designs of fish, and other natural and fanciful sea
                creatures are some the best examples of 'repousse 'work in
                England. Items were sold at Penzance and to a wider market which
                included Liberty of London. Similar work though in usually flat
                plate form was produced by the Keswick School of Industrial Art.
              </p>
              <p>
                The broad range of people involved in creating objects in arts
                and crafts style has meant that a great number of pieces of
                furniture, metalwork embroidery, stained glass and decorative
                items have survived and appear on the market for sale. This has
                encouraged a broader base for collectors, affordable ' amateur'
                pieces being available in most town and cities for tens rather
                than hundreds of pounds.
