              <p>
                The Scottish movement occurred in the late 1880's and 90's, more
                than 20 years after Morris had established his first shop in
                London. The Glasgow School of Art (GSA) was the centre of the
                Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland. Four key figures, Charles
                Rennie Mackintosh, Herbert MacNair, Margaret and Frances
                MacDonald were known as 'The Four' who together created the
                vision which became world famous as the Glasgow Style.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mackintosh attended the Glasgow School of Art in 1883 and became
                a trainee architect in the following year. In 1884 Francis
                Newberry took over as the headmaster of GSA and became a vital
                influence in the development of the movement. Newberry had
                recently moved from London and brought with him an interest in
                Arts and Crafts and an admiration of William Morris. Newberry
                provided leadership for the development of the Glasgow School of
                Art, pushing it forward from its traditional role of formal
                instruction in painting by introducing a range of crafts
                including pottery, embroidery, metalwork, stained glass and
                woodcarving. He started the Art Club, organised exhibitions, and
                promoted the work of his students who included Mackintosh,
                encouraging them to be creative and to take an interest in the
                development Arts and Crafts in England and Europe.
              </p>
              <h2>Glasgow Style</h2>
              <p>

                  alt="Embroidered panel Margaret Macdonald  Mackintosh 1902s GSA"
                  class="caption"

              </p>
              <p>
                Working together The Four, with the support of Newberry,
                compiled an exhibition of beaten metalwork panels, posters,
                furniture and silverwork for the 1896 Arts and Crafts Exhibition
                in London. Their work was not particularly well liked, but one
                important critic, Gleeson White, editor of The Studio was
                intrigued by the style and travelled to Glasgow to meet them, in
                the following year he published two articles in The Studio
                celebrating the Glasgow Style.
              </p>
              <p>
                The style which The Four developed was not to everyone's taste,
                being derided as 'The Spook School' because of the ghostly
                ghoulish images portraying 'hobgoblins by misty moonlight'. An
                important element of Glasgow style was the importance of Celtic
                imagery, with motifs and style of lettering inspired by carvings
                on seventeenth century tombstones. A very popular motif was a
                cabbage like rose, the 'Glasgow Rose' which was adapted from
                Aubrey Beardsley and employed widely within Glasgow Style
                design. The Glasgow Rose was also adopted by English designers
                of stained glass, and furniture. Shapland and Petter, the
                Barnstaple furniture manufacturers providing some particularly
                good examples in marquetry, carving and in repousse copper
                panels. See the examples shown in Collecting
              </p>
              <h2>Charles Rennie Mackintosh</h2>
              <p>
                <img
                  alt="Linen Cupboard c 1895 Mackintosh for John Henderson. GSA"
                  class="caption"
                  src="../../sites/default/files/images/mac.jpg"
                  style="float: right;"
                  title="Linen Cupboard c 1895 Mackintosh for John Henderson. GSA"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                The life and work of Rennie Mackintosh, like William Morris was
                of enormous significance in the development of the Arts and
                Crafts style, and too expansive a subject to cover here. (Please
                see the GSA website for more information).Â Â For his work in
                architecture he is known particularly for the extension to the
                Glasgow School of Art which was started in 1898, and for houses
                such as the Hill House and Windyhill. His interior design and
                furniture is perhaps best known for his designs for the Tea
                Rooms in Glasgow which he did for Catherine Cranston in Buchanan
                Street in 1896 ( see design above), Argyle Street in 1897 and
                the Willow Tea Rooms in 1900. His furniture and his interiors
                show a unique and beautiful vision and are revered throughout
                the world. It is hard to identify anyone before or since
                Mackintosh who has shown the same creative genius within the
                field of Arts and Crafts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The works of Mackintosh are beyond the realms of most collectors
                though there are prints and replicas available as well as a
                range of Mackintosh inspired copper, silver and pewter items,
                sometimes referred to as 'Mockintosh'.
              </p>

                George Walton who assisted Mackintosh in the design of the tea
                rooms for Miss Cranston, and who also may have designed for
                Liberty &amp; Co is one of the most significant designers along
                with Earnest Archibald Taylor, George Logan and John Ednie who
                designed for the furniture company Wylie and Lochhead. Other
                designers created artwork, illustrations, designs for furniture,
                jewellery, stained glass and their pieces are not uncommon in
                auction rooms and specialist dealers.
              </p>
              <p>
                An important aspect of the Glasgow Style was the role played by
                women the most notable being the sisters Frances and Margaret
                MacDonald. Important designers include Jessie King illustrator
                and designer, Margaret and Mary Gilmour who designed and crafted
                metalwork, and Ann MacBeth an embroiderer. The 'Glasgow Girls:'
                by Jude Burkhauser is essential reading on the subject. See our
