              <p>
                The attribution of furniture and objects as 'Arts and Crafts',
                or better still as being the work of a specific designer is
                difficult as most pieces were not signed and there are few
                records. There are experts in museums at Cheltenham, Victoria
                and Albert Museum in London and at Glasgow, and there a fair
                number of collectors and experienced dealers who can identify
                Arts and Crafts pieces within their own sphere of interest.
                Attribution becomes very important if you are buying expensive
                pieces and it pays to make sure the receipt has a full
                description of the item including any attribution. Don't rely on
                dealers who claim their items are 'almost certainly' or
                'probably' by a particular maker unless they can produce some
                evidence or are at least willing to give a proper receipt.
                Buying from auction can be exciting but take care, things may
                not be what they appear to be.

                  class="caption"
                  src="../../sites/default/files/images/alibtable2.jpg"
                  style="float: right;"
                  title="Small oak table by Liberty &amp;  Co with squashed heart piercing, supports to top and pegged stretcher"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some very easily recognised features of Arts and
                Crafts pieces particularly in respect to furniture made by
                commercial companies, and by handicrafts schools. Heart shaped
                piercing is perhaps the best known motif and no one seems quite
                sure how this motif became adopted by the Arts and Crafts
                movement. Voysey was particularly fond of using hearts in his
                designs and companies such as Liberty and Shapland and Petter
                also used them extensively. A variety of heart shapes were used;
                elongated, squashed of flattened inverted, and in the case of
                Scottish work, the split heart. Other common motifs are the ying
                yang and the trefoil of three linked circles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Look out for visible signs of construction in the form of pegs,
                dowels, exposed mortise and tennon joints as well as deep
                chamfering.
              </p>
              <p>
                Quality furniture in oak tends to include quarter sawn oak which
                shows very good graining i.e. medulary rays which give color and
                interest. See the illustration of Oak inlaid panel by Shapland
                and Petter. Care in selection of wood should be easy to see as
                visual appeal of the wood itself will be a central decorative
                feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arts and Crafts collectors will know the significance of the
                architectural style in furniture and artefacts, common features
                being a tapering style, gentle arches, roofed construction in
                furniture and in clocks, and the inclusion of stained glass
                panels or decorative glass often in the style of small windows.
              </p>
              <h2>The use of Copper, Mottos and other features</h2>
              <p>
                Another common characteristic is the use of copper for strap
                hinges, repousse panels and handles, often reflecting a medieval
                or romantic style. Copper panels are highly desirable and hand
                beaten repousse if well done can much more pleasing than machine
                pressed. Motifs include galleons, yachts, and Viking ships as
                well as the ever popular hearts and Glasgow roses. There are
                also stylised plants forms often with entwined flowers, Celtic
                entrelac, Honesty and other decorative plant forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're really lucky you may see pieces with inscriptions or
                mottos either carved, pierced or beaten in copper panels. Of
                particular interest here is the style of writing which is very
                often Celtic or 'Quaint' in style. Inscriptions tends to use
                elongated or stylised letters designed for their decorative
                effect and the way they add to the shape of the whole
                inscription and the piece of furniture that they are inscribed
                upon. Whilst inscriptions are pleasing visually, their messages
                are occaisionally too sentimental or a little patronising.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  alt="Ceramic Cabochon on rivetted copper box"
                  class="caption"
                  src="../../sites/default/files/images/agreen.jpg"
                  style="float: right;"
                  title="Ceramic Cabochon on rivetted copper box"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                Other features of arts and crafts design include decorative
                features such as ceramic cabochons ( glazed pottery discs or
                heart shapes in red, blue or green porcelain or peacock enamels)
                many of these were supplied by the Ruskin pottery, those for
                Shapland and Petter were supplied by Branham and Della Robia art
                potteries. Inlay was also used in silver , pewter, and mother of
                pearl as well as marketry in fruitwood , stringing and
                checkering in ebony and stained wood. One of the most important
                features of a good piece of furniture is the design and
                condition of the handles and metalwork, copper being
                particularly attractive and usually preferred with the original
                patina (rather than cleaned with brass cleaner or steel wool)
              </p>
              <p>
                Whatever added decoration of the piece the most important factor
                is the quality of the craftsmanship in construction. People who
                are new to collecting Arts and Crafts furniture should be wary
                of poorly made pieces and watchful for ornamental features added
                after the piece was made. The quality of some of the most
                desirable pieces lies in the thoughtful design, the elegance in
                construction and the natural beauty of the material with which
                they are made. Good pieces are useful and beautiful.
