&lt;h2&gt;Penlee House Art Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Public Gallery and Museum in Penzance is a centre of expertise and leadership in the conservation and display of original pieces from the Newlyn Arts and Crafts movement. As well as being the source of energy in the organisation of exhibitions on the Newlyn School of Painters, museum staff have also considerable knowledge and expertise in Newlyn Copper and artefacts from the Newlyn School. The Museum is the guardian of a very important collection of Newlyn copper, including spectacular pieces by John Mackenzie and by John Pearson and there are plans to make photographs of the collection available on the CHAIN website organised by Museums in Cornwall. The museum also has examples of Hale copper, and other items from the Newlyn School which include Enamel and Crysede silk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Newlyn Art Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you drive from Penzance to Newlyn make sure you look left to see the Newlyn Art Gallery originally named the Passmore Edwards Gallery. This gallery holds the most remarkable pieces of Newlyn work which are on show to the public these are the four copper plaques mounted in the external wall. Facing the road from Penzance to Newlyn . The Plaques, designed by J.D. Mackenzie and made by Philip Hodder in 1895 depicting Earth Air Fire and Water must surely be amongst the largest pieces of work to have been made. It is rather sad to see the finer details of their beauty has been lost somewhat due to their exposure to the weather, but efforts are being made to establish how they may be preserved. &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the largest collection of furniture and artefacts from the Arts and Crafts movement is that held by the V &amp;amp; A in London. As well as the William Morris room and the Frank Lloyd Wright room, there is the new British Gallery which holds excellent examples of furniture by major designers including Ashbee, Godwin, Mackintosh, Walton, and Liberty &amp;amp; Co. There are also fabrics and many other items of decorative art. The library is also a probably the best resource in the country for those researching the Arts and Crafts movement you can check their online catalogue to see the range of items and to search for individual books or catalogues, see the National Art Library.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Cannon Hall museum in Barnsley has a small but an excellent collection of furniture metalwork and ceramics. Many of the items were purchased from Liberty and Co by the Curator Brian Murray between 1977 to 1987, who was able to part fund the collection with grants from the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Arts and Crafts collection is part of a much larger collection which included militaria, paintings and furniture from other periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arts and Crafts collection includes Tudric Pewter from Liberty and Co with several pieces by Archibald Knox, a Tudric architectural style clock and a good range of items with Celtic or enamelled decoration including a mirror and a coal box. Ceramics by Martin Brothers and some superb pieces by William De Morgan are also on show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small collection of furniture includes pieces by Liberty,William Birch,and Shapland and Petter. Liberty pieces include the Wyclif Chair, the Seigbert table, a Walton settee and a small number of other items considered to be by designed by Punnet and made by William Birch. Not all of the furniture is on display, but there are some superb pieces on view in the North Room. From Shapland and Petter there is a sideboard with repouse copper panel and decorative strap hinges and an outstanding smokers cabinet which is must be one of the finest made by the company. It has a copper panel bearing the inscription&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sublime Tobacco Which From East to West Cheers the Tars Labour and the Turkmans Rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 <title>Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester</title>
 <link>http://localhost/ac/tovisit/whitworth.html</link>
 <description>

&lt;div class=&quot;field field-type-text-with-summary&quot;&gt;
  
  
                &lt;p&gt;The Whitworth Art Gallery and Museum in Manchester was originally intended to be a museum of industrial art and design, partly with the aim of inspiring and improving textile design and production in Manchester. For this reason, Sir Charles Robinson&#039;s collection of textiles was purchased for the gallery in 1891. However, as wealthy local collectors began to present gifts of British watercolours and European prints, the emphasis of the collections gradually shifted towards fine art, rather than industrial design and crafts. The gift of a collection of historic wallpapers in 1967 to some extent redressed the overall balance of the collections. Nowadays, although some oil painting and sculpture is represented in the collection (particularly for the modern period), the Gallery sees itself primarily as a specialist centre for the study and display of works on paper and textiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallpapers. The collection of historic and modern wallpapers is one of the most significant. It includes 168 designs by William Morris, some of which are illustrated on the Whitworth website. Designs by Voysey for Sanderson and samples of originals are included in the collection. Designs by Walter Crane and other Arts and Crafts designers are also included in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textiles. The collection of historic and modern textiles is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind outside London. It includes the work of William Morris and other Arts and Crafts designers including Voysey,Lindsay Butterfield, Harry Napper and the Silver Studios. There are 41 items designed by Voysey with carpets designed for Alexander Morton and Co represented. There are also 72 items designed for or manufactured for Liberty and Co.&lt;/p&gt;
