&lt;div class=&quot;field field-type-text-with-summary&quot;&gt;
  
  
                &lt;p&gt;This Camden based gallery have held exhibitions in the past featuring excellent quality furniture from all top makers including Liberty and Co, Heals, Shapland and Petter, and Wylie and Lochhead. This store was featured in the BBC Antiques Show 1999 which showed Liberty and Co antique buyer Nick Springett stocking up for his Regent Street display at Liberty of London. There are no current exhibitions planned but there is always a very good range of excellent furniture, metalware and other items in stock. The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful, making Art Furniture a very good place to start for the new collector as well as good hunting ground for the experienced collector. Art Furniture is highly commended.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Antique Trader at the Millinery Works. &quot; class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/images/millinery.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; title=&quot;The Antique Trader at the Millinery Works. &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Islington based centre is one of the most proactive centres for Arts and Crafts in London and the depth of knowledge and the real enthusiasm which this gallery brings to exhibitions makes them essential viewing . Printed catalogues with illustrations are published for each exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gallery has organised several exhibitions in recent years including the highly acclaimed &#039;In the Glasgow Style&#039; which included significant pieces from George Walton, Earnest Archibald Taylor, George Logan as well as other members of the &lt;a href=&quot;branches/glasgow.html&quot;&gt;Glasgow School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other exhibitions have specialised in Heals,in Liberty&#039;s furniture and artefacts, in The Cotswold School, and a particularly interesting exhibition in June 1999 focussed on &#039;The Arts and Crafts Chair&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a good stock of furniture and decorative items on view, and the Antique Trader is highly commended.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;By far the most prestigious and comprehensive exhibition in the UK is the Liberty and Co. annual selling exhibition which usually takes place in May at the Regent Street shop in London. Previous exhibitions have included a wide range of furniture including high quality items from Liberty and Co, Shapland and Petter, Heals and Son, Wylie and Lochhead. Exhibitions usually include an extensive range of metal ware including beaten copper ware from the Keswick and Newlyn schools, Tudric Pewter, including very fine pieces designed by Archibald Knox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printed catalogues with photo and sketched illustrations have been published for individual exhibitions in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
