              <p>
                London had been the centre of development for the Arts and
                Crafts movement in the 1880's with new groups being established
                as interest spread. One of the most important was the Guild of
                Handicraft started by Charles Ashbee. When the lease on Guild
                workshops at Essex House ran out, members of the Guild agreed to
                move away from the noise and grime of East London in favour of
                the clean air and tranquillity of life in the Cotswolds at the
                village of Chipping Campden in 1902. Before the Guild arrived
                however, there was already a thriving Arts and Crafts enterprise
                set up by Earnest Gimson and the Barnsley brothers Earnest and
                Sidney who had moved from London 1893
              </p>
              <p>
                The story of Gimson and the Barnsleys is recorded in an
                excellent book by Mary Greenstead who describes how the young
                Gimson had been much inspired by William Morris who he had met
                when Morris was giving a lecture in Leicester.( See Reading)
                Gimson was somewhat of a protege for Morris who introduced him
                to the London architect J. D. Sedding. Gimson took up articles
                with Sedding who's offices were next door to Morris and Co in
                Oxford Street. Through his work he met Earnest and Sidney
                Barnsley who had also moved to London to train as architects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gimson and Sidney Barnsley joined the newly established firm of
                Kenton and Company in 1890 designing furniture, some of which
                was exhibited at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition in 1891. Kenton
                and Co was established as part of an effort to improve standards
                of design and craftsmanship as opposed to production of a wide
                range of mediocre but commercial products. When the firm
                disbanded in 1892, Gimson and the Barnsleys decided to move to
                the country and the idea of setting up a craft community, with '
                a few capable and trustworthy craftsmen' became a driving force.
              </p>
              <p>
                Settling at Pinbury, they established a joint workshop producing
                furniture of very high quality construction and innovative
                design . The solidity and honesty of the construction of their
                pieces was appreciated at the time, and their 'open joinery'
                with wooden pins, and dovetail joints undisguised, helped to
                establish their style It is however interesting that the style
                also included decorative inlays in fruitwood and other
                materials, chamfering, stringing and other rather elaborate
                techniques which seem at odds with the notion of plain and
                simple furniture. These techniques however became widely adopted
                in the design of furniture for commercial manufacturers.
              </p>
              <h2>Ashbee's Guild of Handicrafts.</h2>
              <p>
                This was a much larger venture and 150 men women and children
                moved with Ashbee from London's East End to Chipping Campden to
                set up the new community workshop based around an old silk mill.
                The project thrived at first, workers produced their own
                vegetables, raised pigs and chickens as well working at their
                craft during the day. At its best, the workshop was producing
                fine quality work in woodcarving, cabinet making, silverwork,
                jewellery, enamelling and ironwork. Items which survive today
                are much treasured by collectors and command very high prices.
              </p>
              <p>
                After several years the community was struggling to continue as
                demand for their work began to decrease. Ashbee is said to have
                blamed Liberty and Co for tempting customers away with antiques
                and 'novelties' but there were other factors such as remoteness
                of the workshop from its London customers that may have played a
                part in the downfall. It is interesting that the idyllic picture
                portrayed by Ashbee of the cooperative workshop was not shared
                by the workers, who apparently followed Ashbee's direction,
                accepting the work and living arrangements without sharing his
                high ideals. Nevertheless, Ashbee's belief that '' The standard
                of work and the standard of life are one ..'' still has a
                powerful appeal today.
