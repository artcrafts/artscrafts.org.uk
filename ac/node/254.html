                The Arts and Crafts furniture of Shapland and Petter of
                Barnstaple is now the subject of an authoritative fully
                illustrated book on the company. The book, which was part of a
                larger project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund has been
                published by the Museum of Barnstaple and North Devon.
              </p>
              <p>
                The book was reviewed by Mark Eastment in the Decorative Arts
                Society Newsletter (April 2006) who says:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  This groundbreaking book is the first to deal with the Arts
                  and Crafts Furniture of Shapland and Petter in 1894 to 1914.
                  Combining previously undocumented archive material ..this book
                  provides an opportunity to review many assumptions made when
                  dealing with furniture so often described as being in the Arts
                  and Crafts Style, linked to Liberty's or the British Art
                  Nouveau Movement. Over 200 illustrations, mainly in colour
                  show the enormous variety of the work produced during this
                  brief period illustrating a glorious use of fine inlays, cut
                  outs and repoussé. The book is well written edited and
                  designed and confirms yet another new area of possible
                  scholarship (and collecting) to be explored
                </p>

              <h2>Summary of the book</h2>
              <p>
                Shapland and Petter furniture has become increasingly sought
                after by collectors and the prices of the best examples of
                decorated furniture have continued to increase in recent years
                as more is known about the company and their very distinctive
                style. However, whilst there is already a strong market for
                British collectors of Shapland and Petter, many pieces sold at
                auction have not been recognised or properly attributed to the
                company, most being assumed to be made by Liberty and Co or the
                Glasgow based retailer Wylie and Lochhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                This book brings a wealth of new information about the designs
                and trade catalogues of the company at the turn of the century
                and this will certainly be welcomed by those interested in Art
                Nouveau and Arts and Crafts style in furniture and interior
                decoration. The author Daryl Bennett has undertaken extensive
                research in the company archives and the National Art Library
                working with the museum, and a team of volunteers who have
                helped to establish a digital database of the company. The book
                draws upon this information using period photographs and
                drawings to illustrate company style, picturing fine examples
                from contemporary collections of Shapland and Petter alongside
                their original designs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The history of the company is explained within the broader story
                of 'artistic' furniture design and the development of the Arts
                and Crafts movement in the South West of England. Shapland and
                Petter were a major employer in North Devon from the mid
                Victorian period and continued making furniture and bespoke
                joinery through the twentieth century. The company still exists
                today as the joinery manufacturer Leader Flush Shapland. During
                their high period as an 'art furnisher' Shapland and Petter
                produced an enormous range of furniture in revival styles but
                also specialised in artistic furniture in the 'New Art' or Arts
                and Crafts style.
              </p>
              <p>
                The classic Shapland and Petter style relies essentially on high
                quality construction, with characteristic geometric arches,
                squared spindles and heavily decorated in a variety of
                techniques which include inlaid work, repousse copper panels and
                stencilled work. The beauty of these pieces lies in the
                selection of wood; highly figured oak and fine mahogany and in
                the decoration of pieces which shows a wide range of handicrafts
                and artistic skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                In many ways the company represented a bridge between a
                traditional Arts and Crafts workshop and a modern manufacturing
                cabinet maker, able to provide for a wide marketing and
                retailing sector. Commercially their use of technology and their
                marketing which included a shop in London's West end helped them
                to thrive but they also managed to retain the skills in design
                and in repousse work, enamelling, inlaid work and stained glass
                which give the unique character to each piece.
              </p>
              <p>
                The book by Daryl Bennett is 132 page full colour with over 200
                illustrations of furniture and company designs and will be of
                interest to collectors and an invaluable reference book for
                dealers and auction houses. An explanation of the registration
                numbers, company marks and distinctive characteristics is
                provided in order to enable greater confidence in recognition of
                pieces. This book is an invaluable guide for dealers, auction
                houses and collectors.
              </p>

              <h2>Shapland and Petter illustrated talks</h2>
              <p>
                Since publication, the Shapland and Petter book has sold well
                with interest from Canada, USA and Australia. It was well
                reviewed by the Antiques Trade Gazette and by the Decorative
                Arts Society Newsletter, and has been welcomed by decorative
                arts and furniture specialists at Cheltenham and the V&amp;A
                museums. It has also received acclaim from collectors, dealers,
                auctioneers with specialist interest in the decorative arts. The
                author, Daryl Bennett gave illustrated talks on Shapland and
                Petter to the Gulbenkian Judges, the Charles Rennie Macintosh
                Society in York, The Arts and Crafts Network in Cheltenham and
                the Victorian Society in Sheffield. Further engagements are
                planned for 2014 and any Society or study group wishing to
                arrange a talk by the author should contact him at
