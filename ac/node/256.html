                During 2005, the Arts and Crafts furniture of the Barnstaple
                based Shapland and Petter company was the subject of two
                important public exhibitions in UK. The Museum of Barnstaple and
                North Devon hosted the first ever Shapland and Petter exhibition
                in May and June 2005, followed by the Cannon Hall Museum
                exhibition in July to October 2005. These exhibitions celebrated
                the very best of Shapland and Petter Arts and Crafts furniture
                with some of the finest examples on show. The
                <a href="http://localhost/ac/node/branches/sandp/sandpbook.html"
                  >book</a
                >
                to accompany the exhibition Shapland and Petter Arts and Crafts
                Furniture by Daryl Bennett proved to be a popular purchase for
                many who visited. A limited number of exhibition catalogues and
                original posters are still available and may well prove to be
                collectable.
              </p>
              <h2>Barnstaple Research Project</h2>
              <p>
                <img
                  alt="Repoussé copper panel with motto, Shapland and Petter Bureau"
                  class="caption"
                  src="../../sites/default/files/images/sandp05.jpg"
                  style="float: right;"

                />
              </p>
              <p>
                The recent exhibitions were funded through the Heritage Lottery
                Fund Grant awarded to the Museum of Barnstaple and North Devon
                in 2004,with additional funding from the Cannon Hall Museum in
                Barnsley. The HLF grant amounted to £50,000 and represented a
                major achievement in the development of the Shapland and Petter
                project which was initiated by Daryl Bennett working with Alison
                Mills at the Museum and Claire Gulliver. The whole project
                attracted funding from the Local Authority and from the Leader
                Flush Shapland company which is a subsidiary of the original
                Shapland and Petter firm, and total of £100,000 in cash and in
                kind contributions was raised.
              </p>
              <h2>Exhibition, Archive and Book</h2>
              <p>
                The outcomes of the project were to fund the Barnstaple
                exhibition with the accompanying book
                <a href="http://localhost/branches/sandp/sandpbook.html"
                  >'Shapland and Petter of Barnstable: Arts and Crafts
                  Furniture'</a
                >
                and also to provide a lasting archive of the work of the company
                in the Arts and Crafts period drawing on the extensive records
                held at the museum. A wealth of period photographs and documents
                were donated to the museum from the Leaderflush company over a
                period of years and this represents a very important resource
                for research and attribution. Added to the archive, as a result
                of the project were important examples of furniture catalogues.
                These, previously unknown or unrecognised documents, have
                enabled a comprehensive picture of the range and depth of the
                work of the company to be developed and helped to identify major
                influences in design. These sources of design are explained more
                fully in the book.

              <h2>Local Involvement in Barnstaple</h2>
              <p>
                The project was greatly assisted by people in Barnstaple
                particularly local historian Margaret Reed, and many others who
                contributed to the project group and brought their recollections
                of the work of the company to be recorded as oral history. A
                publication by Alison Mills and Claire Gulliver presents this
                oral history focussing on the more recent, post Arts and Crafts
                years of the company seen through the eyes of employees and
                members of the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most successful elements of the project was to
                involve local school children in learning about Shapland and
                Petter designs particularly the repoussé copper work at which
                they excelled. Sarah Montague, led the schools project and Colin
                Pill a copper enthusiast worked with pupils to produce copper
                decorations for small oak boxes, based on Shapland and Petter
                design. This application of traditional Arts and Crafts skills
                to the modern curriculum proved to be a very welcome part of the
                exhibition linking Barnstaple today with its cultural heritage
                of over 150 years of furniture making.
              </p>
              <h2>National Research</h2>
              <p>
                Whilst there was much information in Barnstaple about the
                company, an important contribution to the project came in the
                form of research at the National Art Library in the Victoria and
                Albert Museum (V&amp;A) and also in archives of Auctioneers and
                Universities across the UK. This research produced examples of
                period advertising and articles about the company. This
                information confirmed their aspirations as creators of 'artistic
                furniture' with their exclusive designs involving hand crafted
                decoration in copper work, inlay and enamelling carried out in
                their own workshops in Barnstaple. The research has helped to
                confirm the importance of Shapland and Petter, alongside other
                makers such as Wylie and Lochhead Pratts of Bradford, and
                J.P.White who made up designs by M.H. Baillie Scott.

              </p>
              <h2>Gulbenkian Shortlist</h2>
              <p>
                Taken together the elements of the project added up to a very
                successful programme of work and the Museum was shortlisted for
                the Gulbenkian Prize, in the top ten of all UK projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Gulbenkian Panel judges led by Joan Bakewell visited the
                project in Barnstaple and the project when completed was listed
                as case study on the HLF website. The benefits of the project
                have been to win a place for the study of the Arts and Crafts
                movement in mainstream heritage funding programmes and to show
                the very best examples of the company’s work within a wider
                national audience. For collectors, furniture historians and
                dealers in decorative arts the project has added significant
                knowledge providing an evidence base which enables more accurate
                attribution of Shapland and Petter pieces. This knowledge base,
                fully developed within the book helps to reduce the vagueness in
                attribution of furniture of this period, much of which has been
                incorrectly attributed to Liberty and Co.
