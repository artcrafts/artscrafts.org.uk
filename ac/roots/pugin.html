                Augustus Pugin was the leading figure in the revival of the
                Gothic style which became increasingly important throughout the
                nineteenth century, gradually replacing Classical styles in
                popularity. The Arts and Crafts movement has its roots in the
                Gothic revival and this page gives a brief guide to Gothic style
                and its influence.

              </p>
              <p>Kenneth Clarke writing of the Gothic revival said:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  It changed the face of England, building and restoring
                  churches all over the countryside, and filling our towns with
                  Gothic banks and grocers, Gothic lodging houses and insurance
                  companies, Gothic everything from a town hall to a slum public
                  house..
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Gothic is a term used to describe a style of European
                Architecture which begin in the late twelfth century and
                dominated building design in Europe until the sixteenth. The
                wealth and power of the church at that time provided the money
                and the inspiration to build great churches and these are most
                common, though not the only, kind of Gothic building which also
                includes civic buildings, university buildings, hospitals and
                town houses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Gothic style uses certain architectural design patterns to
                enable the creation of soaring spaces lit by numerous large
                windows. Architecture before the Gothic age had used thick walls
                to bear the structural load of a building. An important
                characteristic of Gothic building was to treat only narrow
                portions of the walls as load-bearers, enabling the rest of the
                wall to be punctured by windows. Buttresses were also widely
                used, further reducing the need for thick walls and allowing
                spaces of great height to be achieved. Windows were normally
                pointed which enabled them to be larger and higher than
                curved-arch windows, thus giving more light and, with the use of
                stained glass, colour to the interior.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gothic architecture evolved through experiment and inspiration
                and relied upon the highest levels of skill and creativity from
                craftsmen. Religion was the major driving force for the masons
                and carvers who created these great buildings, they 'exercised
                their talents in the service of God '. Their work was inspired
                and uplifting in itself and nineteenth century Gothic
                revivalists supposed that these craftsmen also enjoyed a sense
                of freedom and creativity, moving around the country as
                buildings were completed and new churches were commissioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                The European Renaissance led to the Gothic style being overtaken
                by classical models, and Renaissance writers tended to denigrate
                the previous style as archaic, uncivilised, even barbaric (the
                word 'Gothic' was originally an insult, associating the style
                with German tribes who had ransacked Rome). Classical styles
                were based on elements found in ancient Greek and Roman
                architecture, including strict proportions, columns from a
                limited stock of orders, colonnades, domed roofs, and other
                features. In various forms and degrees of adherence to its
                fundamental principles, classicism dominated architecture in
                Britain until well into the nineteenth century.
              </p>
              <p>
                As industrialisation progressed in Britain, so to did a reaction
                against machine production and the appearance of factory
                buildings. By 1834 Thomas Carlyle and Augustus Pugin had
                established a critical view of industrial society in their
                writing and had started to point back to pre-industrial medieval
                society as a golden age. To Pugin, Gothic architecture was
                infused with the high Christian ideals and values that had been
                eclipsed by classicism and were being destroyed by
                industrialisation.
              </p>
              <h2>Pugin's two 'great rules' for design.</h2>
              <p>
                Pugin's definition of the two great rules for design, defined
                the real nature of Gothic, and were to become the most important
                influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. These principles
                were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <div class="ld">
                    First that there should be no features about a building
                    which are not necessary for convenience, construction or
                    propriety.
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="ld">
                    Second, that all ornament should consist of the essential
                    construction of the building.
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Pugin applied his vision to the whole field of design. As well
                as his work in the design of buildings he designed furniture,
                and from his architectural practice he also designed and
                produced stained glass, metalwork, textiles and jewellery. The
                Gothic revival architects who followed Pugin, notably William
                Burges and George Edward Street carried on the new approach to
                furniture design, taking responsibility for designing the
                building and its internal fittings and furnishings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The revival of Gothic style was also the work of John Ruskin, an
                architectural critic who attacked classical architecture because
                of its aim for perfection and for its demands upon the men who
                were required, as slaves to build it. For Ruskin, Gothic was the
                architecture of free craftsmen. Their work being a natural and
                noble activity where the result might not have a perfect machine
                finish but it was an honest creation. This notion of natural and
                honest imperfection was called 'Savageness' and was very
                influential in the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin believed
                also that human needs should dictate how buildings were designed
                and craftsmen should be free to adapt and to change rather than
                follow a rigid style. This principal of 'Changefullness' was
                also an important influence on Arts and Crafts thinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the Gothic revival we can see important influences on the
                Arts and Crafts Movement. First, the high value placed on
                craftsmanship creativity and the view that work should be
                meaningful in itself. Secondly the emphasis on creative design
                and importance of functional and purpose rather than decoration.
                Thirdly the integrity and honesty of construction, which relies
                upon the natural beauty of materials used in construction. In
                terms of design, important influences included the view that the
                structure should be exposed so the ingenuity in creating and
                holding the structure together can be shown honestly and
                appreciated. The decoration relied largely on the natural beauty
                of the materials and also on hand crafted work, with organic
                forms as decoration, reflecting the handiwork of God.

                A wider appeal for the Gothic revival developed in the latter
                half of the nineteenth century as the interpretation of Gothic
                was much debated. For those in the avant garde, seeking relief
                from the oppressive classical tradition the new 'Gothick ' was
                very appealing as it evoked a medieval sense of barbarism, of
                heroic endeavour and of the heartiness of 'Merry England' in the
                middle ages. The single most important figure in the development
                of Arts and Crafts from this time on was, of course, William
                Morris.
