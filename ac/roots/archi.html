              <p>
                The Arts and Crafts movement began in late nineteenth century
                Britain and had roots in the revival of medieval and Gothic
                architectural styles. Leading figures in the early development
                of the movement were men from wealthy families, well educated
                either at Oxford or Cambridge University. Almost all of them
                were practicing architects or, like William Morris, trained in
                architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the nineteenth century the taste in design for buildings
                moved away from Classical styles. These styles were based on
                design patterns which were formulated and expressed in ancient
                Greece and Rome, and included certain rules of proportion and a
                limited stock of shapes such as the 'orders' of columns.
                Classical elements of this kind had been used in a variety of
                ways - from the unconstrained Baroque style to disciplined
                Palladianism, but in one form or another they had dominated the
                design of large state buildings, churches, and country houses,
                for two hundred years.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the place of classical styles the new architectural styles
                of, first, Gothic Revival, and then Arts and Crafts emerged.
                Gothic style is easily recognised by pointed arches and high
                pitched roofs, with structural support being provided by webbed
                vaulting and butresses, rather than the strength of walls. The
                Houses of Parliament in London (main buildings opened in 1852)
                is a an example of a Gothic revival building, although purists
                in the Gothic Revival movement would complained that its
                symmetries and repetitive patterning make it a debased example.
              </p>
              <p>
                Proponents of the Gothic style placed great emphasis on
                individual skill and craftsmanship in construction. There was
                also an emphasis on a very practical approach to design in which
                usefulness and comfort of the building for the occupants was an
                important design goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arts and Crafts architecture followed these principles, allowing
                the function of the building and the activities within it to
                determine the outer shape and the construction, leaving out
                excessive ornamental features. One departure from Gothic style
                was that Arts and Crafts buildings tended to have graceful
                curved arches rather than pointed and many were designed on a
                modest scale, in styles reminiscent of the manorial halls and
                half timbered cottages of Tudor or Elizabethan England. The
                preference for local slate, and red brick, for English Oak and
                for the cosy Inglenook fireplace rather than ornate lead roofs
                and carved marble chimney piece defined the Arts and Crafts
                style.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was also a contrast in values between classical
                architecture and Arts and Crafts. Classical architecture was
                seen as being built by slave labour or, in more recent times, by
                wage slaves, whereas Arts and Crafts relied on a partnership
                between designer and craftsman in which the craftsman was highly
                respected alongside the artist and architect . There was too a
                greater concern for equality, and a concern to improve the
                quality of life which a building could provide for its
                occupants. Charles Voysey for example took great care in the
                design of servants accommodation in his houses to ensure they
                had good light and space, believing that it would shame any man
                to have his servants in poor accommodation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The important contribution of architects such as Pugin and
                Voysey stems from their involvement in the design of furnishing
                and decoration. They continued their interest after the building
                structure was complete, and followed through into interior
                design and decorative art. This interest beyond the
                architectural started early in the history of the movement when
                architects were unable to find the right kind of furniture to
                match the new style of buildings which they had designed.
                Neither the furniture available from manufacturers at the time,
                nor the antique furniture which could be acquired fitted in with
                the new styles and so architects designed furniture and fittings
                to match the buildings and interiors which they had created.
              </p>

                />
              </p>
              <p>
                These architect-designers left their personal touch on the
                smallest detail of the design inside and outside of the
                building. As well as including designs for furniture ,they often
                designed the light fittings, wallpaper, door furniture, and even
                keys, window latches ,doorbells and clocks. See for example the
                design for a clock by Charles Voysey which is shown opposite
                (with kind permission of the Royal Institute of British
                Architects).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early history of the Arts and Crafts movement, William
                Morris is perhaps the best known architect designer and later
                Hugh Mackay Baillie Scott and Charles Voysey were prominent.
                However if there were any single figure to be credited as the
                father of the movement, the name of Augustus Welby Northmore
                Pugin would undoubtedly spring to the minds of most art
                historians. See
